## PROMPT

Weâ€™ve created a new smartphone app that enables users to snap a photo of a business card and have the information from the card automatically extracted and added to their contact list. We need you to write the component that parses the results of the optical character recognition (OCR) component in order to extract the name, phone number, and email address from the processed business card image. We have provided you with a basic specification [1] and a series of example inputs [2] and would like you to provide the implementation.
